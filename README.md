# Online-Faculty-Directory-for-Multi-University
Online Faculty Directory for Multi-University Project is a project implemented by Java and MySQL database project that helps students to select faculty and read their details.
We use a singleton design pattern in the database connection class to avoid making the connection several times in several functions or classes and to ensure making only one initailizatoin to the instance of the class.
